## Synopsis

An action platformer game powered by Löve, in this game, the player takes comand on one of tree possible heroes, each with unique habilities as they try to save inocent victims in hostage situations. the game will feature an overworld, upgradable weapons, unique game styles for each character, several types of enemies, and a simple and linear story.

## Motivation
I wanted to toy around with Löve capabilities and make a game that was somewhat simple yet interesting to play, so far the game is not even functional but i'll get there in time, im not very good at LUA to be honest, but that's what the journey of discovery is all about isn't it ?, any way, it anly means that it'll take me time to get it all right.

## Installation

You can download the whole project as a zip, unzip it, and open it with unity, if you want to see the game in action, the "Build" folder contains a Standalone folder, one for each system, download the folder of your system, and double click the file to play (once the game is completed you will be able to grab it from steam’s shop, steam features will be added to the game).

## Disclaimer

The game is still on development, story is still not implemented, for now the main focus of the game is implementation of the game mechanics.

## Special thanks

Special thanks to Löve for the awesome framework and documentation adn the comunity behind it.
